# HTML & CSS Practice Projects

This repository contains a collection of simple HTML and CSS pages created for learning and practicing front-end development.
Each file demonstrates different concepts of HTML such as forms, layouts, lists, grids, and fun experimental pages — along with CSS techniques like styling, positioning, animations, transitions, and responsive design.

Through these projects, you can explore how structure (HTML) and design (CSS) work together to build beautiful and interactive web pages.
